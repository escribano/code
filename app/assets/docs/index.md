Pretty cool technique to actually change the url of the page (something until now impossible to do in Javascript for security reasons):

Also good to read, the browser history MDC documentation:

And finally, pjax, a new script that combines the use oj Ajax calls and this technique to manipulate the url to achieve a beautiful ajax navigation experience, with permalinks and without the need of using location.hash.
