# router

a lightweight router middleware

## Installation

```
npm install git://github.com/snd/router.git
```

## Usage

### Make a router

```coffeescript
Router = require 'router'

router = new Router
```

### Define some routes

see [url-pattern](https://github.com/snd/url-pattern) for supported url patterns.

the params extracted from the url will be available as `req.params`.

```coffeescript

# called before every following route
router.all '*', (req, res, next) -> next()

# called only on GET /
router.get '/', (req, res, next) -> res.end 'hello'

# called before every following route if the request url starts with /users
router.all '/users*', (req, res, next) -> next()

router.post '/users', (req, res, next) -> res.end 'posted'

router.put '/users/:id', (req, res, next) ->
    # called for example on PUT /users/7 - req.params will then be {id: 7}

router.delete '/users/:id', (req, res, next) ->
    # called for example on DELETE /users/18 - req.params will then be {id: 18}
```

### Use the middleware

```coffeescript
http = require 'http'

server = http.createServer router.middleware

server.listen 80
```
